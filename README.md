Form Validation Project

This project demonstrates a basic form validation system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Project Structure:

index.html: The main HTML file containing the form with input fields and validation output.
style.css: The CSS file styling the form and its elements.
script.js: The JavaScript file responsible for handling the validation logic.
Functionality:

The user fills out the form with required information.
On submission, the script checks the input fields for validity using regular expressions and other validation rules.
If all fields are valid, the form is submitted successfully.
If any field is invalid, the user sees error messages indicating what needs to be corrected.
Features:

Basic Validation: The script currently checks for required fields, valid email addresses, and valid phone numbers.
Visual Feedback: The form elements change color and display messages to guide the user.
Clear Instructions: The form includes helpful labels and placeholder text.
